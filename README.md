The application consists out of two activities, one for accessing patients medical details and an other one to monitor those patients after having left the hospital using sensor.
In case of falling down, a fall is detected, a caretaker receives a message alert. 
This can also be used in case of other immergence case( heart attack or other complications).
The patient will only need to shake his phone and the alert message will be sent to the care giver.
